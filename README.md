1. The placeBet and betIsMade methods in the Bet class are much shorter. We also reduced the number of parameters to pass to Bet constructor.
2. We now have to pass a Wheel object as a parameter when winBet is called inside of BetIsMade().
3. We traded more classes for better readability and shorter functions.
4. We prefer our code because it is more readable and concise.
